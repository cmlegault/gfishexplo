Groundfish Explorations

## Question: can adding recent catch allow increase in quota? Yes, maybe.

Premise is that missing catch, due to underestimated discards and/or improperly labelled landings could be the main source of retrospective patterns in recent groundfish stock assessments. This work explores this concept with the hypothesis that ABCs could be increased if this is true to offset management measures such as 100% observer coverage or dockside monitoring. 

## What was done?

A stock assessment that exhibited a strong retrospective pattern was used as a starting point. Catch multipliers were searched for that elimated the retrospective pattern for different starting years. These modified assessments were followed through to catch advice applying an F40% rule to compare with the original assessment and the original assessment with retrospective adjustment.

## Case Study 1: Witch Flounder (SARC 62, 2016)

The benchmark assessment for witch flounder at SARC 62 rejected the proposed ASAP model due to a strong retrospective pattern (https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/publications/crd/crd1701/, https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/publications/crd/crd1703/, and https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/saw/saw62/sarc62_panel_summary_report.pdf). An ASAP file similar to the final run examined in SARC 62 was used as the starting point for this exercise. This assessment formulation used years 1982-2015, ages 1-11+, one fleet with three selectivity blocks, and five survey tuning indices (NESFS spring and fall scaled by the catchability study, ASMFC summer, and ME/NH spring and fall surveys). This assessment exhibited a strong retrospective pattern with Mohn's rho values of 0.64 and -0.46 for SSB and F, respectively.
